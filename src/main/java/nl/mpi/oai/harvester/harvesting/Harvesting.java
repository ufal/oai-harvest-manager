/**
 * <br> A protocol for processing metadata elements <br><br>
 *
 * The methods specified in this interface constitute an protocol for
 * processing metadata elements obtained by an application of the OAI protocol.

 * The request method is intended to cover the various primitives in
 * the OAI protocol, like ListIdentifiers, ListRecords, and ListPrefixes. The
 * the other methods in the interface concern the handling of the response or
 * responses received.
 *
 * A particular application of the protocol defined in this class is called a
 * 'scenario'. An example of a scenario would be: to harvest metadata records
 * by listing records. In this case the the request method should create a
 * request based on this verb. The processResponse method should create a list
 * of metadata records, and the parseResponse should return the records one by
 * one. <br><br>
 *
 * Another example of a scenario would be to harvest metadata records by first
 * obtaining their identifiers. In this case, the request method should create
 * a request based on the ListIdentifiers verb. The, processResponse method
 * should create the list of identifiers, and the parseResponse method should
 * use the GetRecord verb to get the records one by one.
 *
 * Note: for more information on the OAI protocol, please refer to
 * <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.htm">
 *     its specification</a>.
